0	Figure 12 shows the chloride ion penetration resistance experiment results for the concrete specimens.	In the same manner as in Section 4.2.2, the test results are subsequently discussed in terms of three influencing factors: (1) mix proportioning method, (2) with and without RCA coating treatment, and (3) RCA replacement ratio.
1	Figure 14a-d show that the RCPT values of CRP-aS, CRP-bS, ERP-aS, and ERP-bS mixes decreased by 21%, 37%, 10%, and 24%, respectively, compared to those of CRP-a, CRP-b, ERP-a, and ERP-b.	However, a significant interaction between the serum vitamin D level and obesity was identified.
